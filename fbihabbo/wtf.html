SM Ranks+<br />
The highest ranks of the &lt;F.B.I&gt;, SM+, are expected to be models for the &lt;F.B.I&gt; and lower ranks. They must dress professionally.<br /><br />
 
// Article (2) Transfer Requirements<br />
Because of our agency's size (85,000+) not all transfers will keep a rank similar to their rank in their old agency. If your agency is considerably smaller your rank will be lower.<br /><br />
 
> You must have at least 500 people on your main badge to transfer.<br />
>> Rank based on agency size<br />
    > Agency: 500 - 2000 /: Receives a few rank groups lower<br />
    > Agency 2000 - 5000 /: Receives a rank group or two lower<br />
    > Agency 5000+ /: Receives similar rank<br /><br />
 
You must have been at your previous agency for 5+ days and provide a reason you are leaving.<br /><br />
 
//: For transfer unit: You should do more than just transfer your transferee.<br />
  // Transfer Mentor Program<br />
  - After you transfer you must keep track of the person you transferred. Give them a tour of the HQ, make sure they know all the commands, and show them how to use security. If they have any questions they should come to you.<br />
  - Over their trial period you should monitor them, fix any issues they have, and watch to see when they are ready to come off their trial or if they aren't suited for the &lt;F.B.I&gt;.<br />
  - Those who transfer should also be the ones who promote their transferee out of their trial or fire them if they aren't right for the &lt;F.B.I&gt;. Trial periods should last 3 to 5 days.<br /><br />

 
Section (C) &lt;F.B.I&gt; Disciplinary Measures<br />
// Article (1) Strikes<br /><br />
 
(A) Who can receive strikes?<br />
> Any member of the &lt;F.B.I&gt; that is RSO+ may receive a strike. Standard ranks should receive a warning and a demotion rather than a strike.<br /><br />
 
(B) Severity of Strikes<br />
> Strikes in the &lt;F.B.I&gt; are more severe than in other agencies. Strikes should not be used as a standard disciplinary measure, rather as a punishment for a larger issue.<br />
> Strikes are never removed unless the person striked goes through an appeal process that is approved.<br /><br />
 
(C) Who can strike?<br />
> Except for the Directorate, no individual can completely strike without going through the strike process.<br />
> That being said, in order to initiate a strike process the person striking must be a rank high enough to demote the person.<br /><br />
 
(D) The Strike Process<br />
  (1) The person being striked commits a strikable offense.<br />
  (2) The person striking should take screenshots, write down witnesses, and gather any other proof about the offense.<br />
  (3) They should then submit a strike form on the website: citing the offense, the proof, the witnesses, etc.<br />
  (4) The strike will be read over, processed, and one of three things will happen:<br />
A) The strike will be approved. The person being striked may appeal. If the appeal is accepted it will go to a court case.<br />

// Article 3) Emergency Procedures<br /><br />
 
In this article, you will learn to deal with issues that may occur in HQ. In the result of these situations, it is important not to panic. Higher ranks have dealt with this before and are capable of dealing with it again. Please use the following advice to aid you:<br />
 <br />
3a) Raiders or Trollers<br />
Place the offending user in ignore by clicking on their avatar and then ‘ignore’;<br />
Do not let them into HQ;<br />
Contact a RR holder and alert them of the situation;<br />
If you are a HR, go ahead and reassure your lower ranks and notify them to ignore the troller if this has not been done already. It is as much your responsibility as it is theirs to respond to the situation accordingly.<br /><br />
 
3b) Trollers Inside HQ<br />
Contact a RR holder immediately to kick or ban the troller(s);<br />
Ensure all FTF seats are occupied by &lt;F.B.I&gt; workers;<br />
If you are a HR, go ahead and reassure your lower ranks and notify them to ignore the troller if this has not been done already. It is as much your responsibility as it is theirs to respond to the situation accordingly.<br /><br />
 
3c) Incorrect B.U.M<br />
B.U.M stands for Badge, Uniform, Motto and must be correct at all times in HQ and appropriate rooms.<br />
To assist a user with their B.U.M, do the following:<br />
Badge: ask them to click on your avatar and join the Agent badge you (should) be wearing or ask them to wear their highest ranking badge;<br />
Uniform: they can obtain this by double clicking on the appropriate mannequins located in the lobby unless they are RSO or higher;<br />
Motto: tell them to change their motto to &lt;F.B.I&gt; Cadet or correct any mistakes in their current motto.<br /><br />
 
3d) Inactivity<br />
The higher rank you are, the less time you should take away from Habbo. Standard ranks are not included in time taken away and are allowed to keep their rank indefinitely.<br />
RSO through to HR may take a maximum of two weeks inactivity before they are deemed inactive and unfit for their rank. After they have been inactive for 14 days or more, their badges will be removed by an administrator and they will have to appeal upon their return. After time allotted members must request a LOA. HR through to SLC may take a maximum of one week inactivity before they are deemed inactive and unfit for their rank. After they have been inactive for 7 days or more, their badges will be removed by an administrator and they will have to appeal upon their return.
OOA do not have guidelines but should not exceed one week inactivity due to their input into the &lt;F.B.I&gt;. However, if their inactivity shows that they are unfit for their rank, a member of Top Management may take their situation into consideration. Length of LOA must be confirmed by a member of Top Management and a decision will be put into place accordingly.</p>

Welcome to the F.B.I Internship, a new exciting project designed to take the best new Recruit’s and current members and turn them into High Rank Agents in a matter of days.<br /><br />
 
So, how does it work?<br /><br />
 
To be eligible to enrol on our Internship, you must be committed, hard working and have the desire to be the best of the best within the F.B.I.
This is open to new members and current lower ranks members, giving all the opportunity to move up the ladder faster than our promotion system allows.<br /><br />
 
The Internship has 20c joining fee. For this small fee, this is what you get:<br /><br />
 
<b>Step 1:</b><br />
Enroll with one of our current members. They will ask you to request the Internship badge, which will be accepted when you pay your joining fee over to one of our Intern Administrators listed below.<br />
You will now be given your badge, and your motto will be change to &lt;F.B.I&gt; Intern<br /><br />
 
<b>Step 2:</b><br />
You must now complete our basic training. This gives you a basic overview of what is expected of our F.B.I staff, and lets us know that you are worthy of your place on the Internship.<br />
You will now be given your Regional Security Officer Badge, jumping two whole sets of ranks. Good job!<br /><br />
 
<b>Step 3:</b><br />
This is where the fun starts! Your next task is to enrol other members.<br />
At this stage, we ask you to find just 1 new member. You will pass Step 3 once the new member is fully enrolled and has been accepted.<br />
You will now be given your Trainer badge. This means you can train new Recruits. Just ask one of our experienced Trainers to show you how!<br /><br />
 
<b>Step 4:</b><br />
Recruit! Recruit! Recruit! - Just like Step 3, your task is to find another member and get them enrolled. Again, you will complete this task when they have been accepted and given their badge.<br />
You will now be given your Legal Compliance Unit badge.<br />
<br />
    <b>The Final Chapter:</b><br />
To complete the Internship, we just want you to find one more member. Get them signed up! Once this is done, you graduate!<br />
You will now be given your High Rank badge.<br /><br />

If you’ve got this far, CONGRATULATIONS, you have passed the F.B.I Internship programme.
